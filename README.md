# q2clean
A clean-ish version of Quake II's game DLL, derived from the QuakeC progs from quake2c.

NOTE: because of the unpredictability of the C++ standards that I was using at the time, and C++ being too slow for compilation, I don't really recommend this be used as a base. It's left up for historical purposes only.
